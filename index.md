## Account Security

### Account & Keys
Traditional blockchain designs use cryptographic hashes to generate globally unique IDs that are statically guaranteed to never have a collision.  However, those hashes require significantly more memory and more CPU cycle to manipulate. It takes more CPU time to look up. Thus, BitShares assign globally unique IDs to BitShares account name.
 
  - An user can name an account easily to remember and communicate 
  - ("human-friendly" account name for our financial transactions?)
  - every BitShares account is assigned a globally unique name.
  - (fee based - special name - the power to adapt market demands) 
  - Dynamic Account Permission
  - Multi user control 
  - multiple keys (protections, more secure experiences)
  - Permission management - should be defined in term of people or organization rather than keys.
