## How to Set up Nignx Webserver

We here use Nginx to deal with Ruby and provide access to the wallet files and the faucet. We use passenger to do so which unfortunatelly requires to compile nginx “manually”. Passenger fortunatelly provides a script that handles all the installation.

### 1. Setup

    sudo apt-get install curl libcurl4-gnutls-dev
    cd ~/faucet
    gem install passenger
    sudo passenger-install-nginx-module

After using the recommended settings and waiting for the script to complete, we integrate nginx into our distribution via

    sudo ln -s /opt/nginx/ /usr/local/nginx
    sudo ln -s /opt/nginx/conf/ /etc/nginx

### 2. Configuration

Nginx is configured using the freshly installed nginx.conf file:

    vi /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf

We have set it to be:

    user gph;
    worker_processes  4;
    
    events {
        worker_connections  1024;
    }
    
    http {
        passenger_root /home/gph/.rbenv/versions/2.2.3/lib/ruby/gems/2.2.0/gems/passenger-5.0.23;
        passenger_ruby /home/gph/.rbenv/versions/2.2.3/bin/ruby;
        passenger_max_request_queue_size 1000;
    
        include       mime.types;
        default_type  application/octet-stream;
    
        access_log  /www/logs/access.log;
        error_log  /www/logs/error.log;
        log_not_found off;
    
        sendfile        on;
        #tcp_nopush     on;
    
        keepalive_timeout  65;
    
        gzip  on;
    
        upstream websockets {
          ## Put the witness node's websocket rpc port here:
          server localhost:11011;
        }
    
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name localhost;
    
            location ~ ^/[\w\d\.-]+\.(js|css|dat|png|json)$ {
                root /www/current/public/;
                try_files $uri /wallet$uri =404;
            }

            location ~ /ws/? {
                access_log off;
                proxy_pass http://websockets;
                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            }  
            location / {
                passenger_enabled on;
                root /www/current/public/;
            }
        }
    }

 > Note: The parameters passenger_root and passenger_ruby may be different in your setup. Please compare with the default nginx.conf file to identify the proper directories.

We create an _upstream _called `websockets` which is uses to proxy the queries to `http://host/ws` directly to the websocket server. This allows to have a websocket address be available from the same port as the web wallet.

### 3. Running nginx as service

We use a nginx service script and can install it according to:

    sudo wget https://raw.github.com/JasonGiedymin/nginx-init-ubuntu/master/nginx -O /etc/init.d/nginx
    sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/nginx
    sudo update-rc.d -f nginx defaults

After that, nginx can be launched with

    sudo service nginx start

> Note: To reload nginx.  `sudo service nginx reload`
