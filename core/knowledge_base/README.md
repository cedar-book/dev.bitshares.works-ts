what is Use Case:

- A use case is a software and system engineering term that describes how a user uses a system to accomplish a particular goal. A use case acts as a software modeling technique that defines the features to be implemented and the resolution of any errors that may be encountered

- User stories are short and briefly state the type of user, the feature needed, and the benefit. 
- Use cases are used during the analysis phase of a project to identify system functionality.
