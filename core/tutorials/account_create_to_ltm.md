## How to create, register and upgrade an account to Lifetime Membership

Without already having an account, or knowing someone that has an account, it is not possible. You canâ€™t create accounts out of nowhere.

But you can work around it by importing an active key of a **Lifetime Member** account that has funds:

1. In the GUI, open the side memu and select the permissionss of an account that is funded and has a LTM status.
1. Click on the BTS public key on the ACTIVE tab, a private key viewer opens. 
1. Click [Show] and copy the private key.
1. In the cli-wallet run: `import_key <account_name> <private_key>`
1. Then run: `suggest_brain_key` and copy the brain key. (You might want to make a backup of your brain key somewhere.)
1. Create a new account with this command: `create_account_with_brain_key <brainkey> <new_account_name> <imported_name> <imported_name> true`

This will create a new account called <new_account_name> and set the registrar and referrer to <imported_name>. The brainkey can be used to regenerate the account (even in the GUI wallet). You can manually delete the other active key from the wallet.json file.
