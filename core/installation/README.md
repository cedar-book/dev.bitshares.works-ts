## Development Environment & Getting Started

BitShares offers you to install BitShares-Core into different platforms; **Ubuntu (x64), OSx, and Windows**.  There are  dependencies to check when you download OpenSSL and  Boost. Please make sure which versions you downloaded. 

Also, if you are a Windows user, you have other two choices to install BitShares Core to your Windows (x64) Operation System.  One is **CLI-Wallet tools for Windows (x64)**, another is **Windows SubSystem for Linux (WSL)**.  

The CLI-wallet tools for Windows (x64) allows you to try several methods to get the data from BitShares blockchain without the BitShares Core installation. After you download the cli-wallet tools, you will find a cli_wallet executable to try Wallet API. 

Another option, Windows SubSystem for Linux (WSL).  This is for a developer who uses a Windows 10 (x64) Operation System and wants to build BitShares Core on Ubuntu. 

> Please check [System Requirements](../nodes_full_witness/full_nodes.md#system-requirements) to run a node (updated: 2018-07-02).
