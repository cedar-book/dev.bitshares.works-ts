## BitShares Accounts

#### Account

In BitShares, you can create own unique account name, so, you can remember easily. And you will use the BitShares account name to communicate (e.g. Send fund) with other BitShares account holders like sending an email. The advantage of using account name is that people can identify you by using a readable and memorable word instead of cryptographic addresses.

Each user has at least one account that can be used to interact with the blockchain. The account can be seen as a single banking account with an individual balance, transaction history, etc. Since these accounts are registered on the blockchain and are open to the public, we recommend to pick a pseudonym to achieve some privacy.

#### Identifier

When you create a BitShares account, BitShares 2.0 registers the account name to the blockchain and also assigns an incrementing identifier (account id) during the registration. 

This comes with many advantages: Besides improved scalability, we have separated the identity from the transaction authorizing signature. In practice, owning an account name is independent from being able to spend its funds. Furthermore, both rights (we call them permissions) can split among an arbitrary complex relation of people (we call them authorities) using weights and a required thresholds.

Thanks to separating authorities from identities, BitShares 2.0 can be much faster in processing delay while having much smaller transaction sizes. All participants are forced to have a named account on the blockchain. And most transactions are tied to the account name and can be linked to individuals (this includes transfered, trades, shorts, etc. but not stealthed transactions).

#### BitShares UI Wallet

If you use BitShares UI (Wallet) to registrar an account, all you need to provide *an account name* and *a password*. 
Your account name can be seen similar to an email address (i.e., **unique**) and every participant in the BitShares network can interact with you by using the account name.

> Note: In contrast to any other platform you have ever used: Creating an account at one of our partners will make your account available at all the other partners as well.
