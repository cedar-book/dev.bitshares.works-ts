## Memberships and Groups


### Memberships

To see your Membership stats, open a side dropdown menu ans select **Membership stats**. 

Accounts in BitShares are separated into three groups. We decided to give users the option to upgrade their accounts into a VIP-like status if they desire and profit from reduced fees and additional features.

### Membership Groups

|   group type       |  note            |
| ------------------- |---------- |
| Non-Members    |  A regular account is a non-member. |                           
| Lifetime Members |Lifetime Members get a percentage cashback on every transaction fee they pay and qualify to earn referral income from users they register with or referrer to the network. A Lifetime membership is associated with a certain one-time fee that is defined by the committee. *Lifetime member (LTM) status* can register an account. If you want to do so, upgrade the account. |                            
| Annual Members    |If a lifetime membership is too much you can still get the same cashback for the next year by becoming an annual subscriber for a smaller one-time fee which lasts for only one year. |         

> Note: Technically, the fees that you pay stay the same, but a part of the fees is refunded in the form of a vesting balance.Once the fees have vested you can withdraw them. 

To see your vesting balances, open the side dropdown menu and select **Vesting balance**.  Vesting balances are recalculated hourly, so you might not yet see them right away.

> Warning: Due to some discrepancies, the annual membership has been disabled in most web wallets and will be re-enabled after a proper update eventually.
