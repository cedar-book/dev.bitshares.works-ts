## How to import a GUI-wallet account into CLI-wallet

CLI and GUI wallet are two separated applications. They use separated ways to represent backups. You can currently only manually import keys from the GUI into the CLI.

Your wallet private keys have extremely important roles. By importing your private keys to a new CLI-wallet, you can control your account funds from the CLI-wallet. 

First, find your private keys in your GUI-wallet
- Login to your GUI-wallet
- Go to [Settings] â€“ [Permissions]. There are Active, Owner, and Memo tabs. 
- In the tab, click your public key (or the key image). It will open a form.
- On the form, click [Show], save your private key information to use later.

Connect the CLI-wallet pointing it to a live node

    ./programs/cli_wallet/cli_wallet --server-rpc-endpoint ws://localhost:8090
    Or 
    ./programs/cli_wallet//cli-wallet -s wss://bitshares.openledger.info/ws

You should get a prompt

    new>>>

Set a password for your CLI-wallet and unlock.

**Note:** This password does not need to be the same with your GUI-wallet password. You will create a *new wallet* and it will be secured by the new password.

    new >>> set_password mypass
    set_password mypass
    null
    locked >>> unlock mypass
    unlock mypass
    null
    unlocked >>>


Import your each private key you saved from your GUI-wallet into your new CLI-wallet.
