Welcome to BitShares! In this section, you will find the overview of BitShares Architecture (repositories and entities), and how the Core team processes the development work.  If you are interested in contributing to the Core team, you might want to check the Contribution Guide and the GitFlow to understand how BitShares-Core team handles the repository files and branches.  If you would like to know the Core team current project, issues, and the releases plans, check under the Issues and the Projects tabs.

### Your purpose and a download branch
The below table list is just a guide. If you are interested to learn BitShares Node or CLI wallet, using TestNet might be adequate to start. If you are a developer who is interested to contribute to the BitShares Core team, downloading a developer branch might be a good start. Select an appropriate branch when you install BitShares-Core.  

After you know which branch to download, your next step is the installation of BitShares-Core. Check the [BitShares Installation Guide](../installation/README.md#install-a-development-environment) and select your Operation System to follow the installation steps. 

Your purpose might be trying some API calls to query the BitShares Blockchain data, using a CLI Wallet to manage your assets, or running a node. In any events, you will create an account and interact with the blockchain. If you install BitShares-Core, it would be a better understanding of the BitShares Node and System Requirements. So, we recommend you to read [the BitShares Nodes](../nodes_full_witness/README.md#bitshares-nodes-and-p2p-network) section and [BitShares Accounts](../accounts/README.md#bitshares-accounts) section before the installation.
