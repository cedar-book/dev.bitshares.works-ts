## Step-By-Step Instructions for Exchanges

We here describe how to interface your exchange with BitShares step-by-step. We will link to a more detailed description where appropriate.

### Installation

In this step-by-step instruction we assume you have successfully built from the sources. If you've not done yet, see the [instruction](/core/installation/README.md#install-a-development-environment).

### Running Daemons and Wallet

For security reasons we will run two daemons and a wallet according to these diagram:

<p align="center">

</p>


In this tutorial we will run all deamons and the wallet on the same machine and use different ports to distinguish them:

* port ``8090``: trusted full node
* port ``8091``: delayed node
* port ``8092``: wallet

Read more details [network-setup](/core/wallet/wallet_network.md#network-and-wallet-configuration)

### Trusted Full Node

The trusted full node is your entry point to the BitShares P2P network. It will hold the blockchain, connect to other peers, and will receive new blocks in *real-time*.

    ./programs/witness_node/witness_node --data-dir=trusted_node/ --rpc-endpoint="127.0.0.1:8090"

> **Note:** Until the genesis block is integrated into the binary/souces, you may additionally need to download the genesis block from github and add the parameter ``--genesis-json <genesis.json>``. (See `Release Page`_)

> **Note:** Unless the seed nodes are encoded into the binary, you may need to add a known seed node with ``-s xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:yyy`` in order to initially connect to the P2P network. (See [Release Page](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core/releases))

> **Note:** To start a node with reduced RAM please see [Memory reduction for nodes](../plugins/nodes_memory_reduction.md#memory-reduction-for-nodes).

### Delayed Node

The delayed full node node will provide us with a delayed and several times confirmed and verified blockchain. All transactions that are confirmed by the delayed node are **irreversible**.

    ./programs/witness_node/witness_node --trusted-node="127.0.0.1:8090" \
                                         --rpc-endpoint="127.0.0.1:8091"
                                         -s "0.0.0.0:0" \
                                         --p2p-endpoint="0.0.0.0:0" \
                                         --seed-nodes "[]"

We will use this node for notifications of customer deposits.

### Wallet

The wallet will be used to transfer assets to the customers. It connects to the trusted full node and has spending privileges for the hot wallet.


    ./programs/cli_wallet/cli_wallet --server-rpc-endpoint="ws://127.0.0.1:8090" \
                                     --rpc-http-endpoint="127.0.0.1:8092"

## Query Blockchain for Required Data


We now use the open ``cli_wallet`` to issue transfers and query the blockchain for more information. First of all, we create a new wallet and set a pass phrase:::

    >>> set_password <password>

	
#### Existing BitShares 1 Account

*We assume that you already have an account on the BitShares blockchain and show how to export it from the BitShares 1 client.*

We first get the account statistics ID (``2.6.*``) of the deposit account to monitor deposits, the memo key for later decoding of memos and the active key for being able to spend funds of that accounts:::

    >>> get_account <account-name>
    {
     [...]
     "active": {
        "key_auths": [[
            "<active_key>",
            1
     ] ], },
     [...]
     "memo_key": "<memo_key>",
     [...]
     "statistics": "<statistics>",
     [...]
    }

We now need to export the corresponding private keys from BitShares 1.0 and import the keys into the ``cli_wallet``:::

    BitShares 1: >>> wallet_dump_private_key <memo_key>
                 "<memo_private_key>"
    BitShares 1: >>> wallet_dump_private_key <active_key>
                 "<active_private_key>"

Import the active key into BitShares 2 wallet:::

    BitShares 2: >>> import_key <account-name> <active_private_key>

This gives access to the funds stored in ``<account-name>``. We will need the memo private key later when watching deposits.


#### Claiming BitShares 1.0 funds

We now describe how to claim your funds from the Bitshares 1 blockchain so you can use them in BitShares 2.

For **Coldstorage** and plain private keys, we recommend to use::

    >>> import_balance <accountname> <private_key> false

to import all balances that are locked in the private key into the account named ``<accountname>``. As long as the last argument is ``false`` the transaction will only be printed for audit and not be broadcasted or executed. **Only** after changing ``false`` to ``true`` will the balances be claimed!

For your hot wallet (or any other active wallet running in the BitShares 1 client) we recommend to use the GUI to claim your funds.

### Watching Deposits with Python

For watching deposits, we recommend pybitshares' *Notify* module. The full documentation is available on  [pybitshares.com](http://pybitshares.com).

### Executing Transfers for Withdrawals

For transfering funds, we recommend pybitshares. This python module enables all features required to operated on/with BitShares. The full documentation is available on [pybitshares.com](http://pybitshares.com).
